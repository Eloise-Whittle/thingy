# 1,500 scientists lif the lid on reproducability 
Monya Baker

## Survey sheds light on the 'crisis' rocking research 

**More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments.** and more then half have failed to reproduce their won experiments. those are some of the telling figures that emerged from *Nature* survey of 1,576 researchers who took a brief online questionnaire on predictability in research.  

The data revealed sometimes-contradictory attitudes towards predictability. Although 52% of those surveyed agreed that there is a significance 'crisis' of reproducible, less than 31% think that failure to reproduce published results means that the result is probabley wrong, and most say that they still trued the published literature. 

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
